# Pending tasks

- Divide tests in int, float and Person
- Review singly linked tests implementation

# 10 rules for developing safety-critical code are:

* Restrict all code to very simple control flow constructs—do not use goto statements, setjmp or longjmp constructs, or direct or indirect recursion.
* Give all loops a fixed upper bound.
* Do not use dynamic memory allocation after initialization.
* No function should be longer than what can be printed on a single sheet of paper in a standard format with one line per statement and one line per declaration.
* The code's assertion density should average to minimally two assertions per function.
* Declare all data objects at the smallest possible level of scope.
* Each calling function must check the return value of nonvoid functions, and each called function must check the validity of all parameters provided by the caller.
* The use of the preprocessor must be limited to the inclusion of header files and simple macro definitions.
* Limit pointer use to a single dereference, and do not use function pointers.
* Compile with all possible warnings active; all warnings should then be addressed before the release of the software.
